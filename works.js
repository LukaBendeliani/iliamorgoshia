      "“The path to happiness” is a documentary film about VHS DVV international’s project. Throughout the movie, we witness the lives of IDPs from Abkhazia and Samachablo. It describes how the war changed their lives and how they got involved in “Adult Education“. People were forced to move away from their place of living and start over. From the stories, we can hear that it was hopeless and impossible to survive in new conditions. It took 1 director, 1 producer, 2 Cameramen,1 driver, and 5 weeks of amazing adventure across Georgia to capture the real beauty of Nature and tell stories never heard before.",
